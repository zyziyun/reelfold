# Changelog

All notable changes to Reelfold (the Mac app, the engine and the Claude Code skill) are listed here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0: minor versions may change behaviour).

App releases are tagged `v*`; engine-only releases are tagged `engine-v*`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.6] - 2026-10-11

### Added

- Every split in the Studio and the editor resizes: drag (or arrow keys on a focused divider), double-click to reset,
  sizes kept on this Mac; the video list folds to a strip (⌘B) and the list's groups fold.

### Changed

- The clip header has room: project · position · length above a larger title, the full title on hover, buttons that
  shrink to icons in narrow windows; the clip page stacks below 700px; one left edge for every section.
- Switching videos returns each column to where it was; the clip page shows its own skeleton while loading and a
  Try again when a clip does not open; the AI panel slides in and out.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-10-11

### Added

- **Studio** (now the main screen): every video in one list — 要你看 / 进行中 / 可以发 / 已排期, each with its current
  step, time left and progress — and one page per clip: editable title, player with covers, caption looks and
  versions, the question that needs you, the transcript, per-platform copy and schedule, and one AI bar. Inbox is a
  filter; the nav is Studio · Calendar · Settings; "＋ New video" (⌘N) starts text, files, Record yourself or Create.
  Title + copy + cover + schedule takes 4 clicks on one screen (was 14+ across 4).
- **Pickups**: stopping a recording opens it in the editor with the automatic cleanup marked; select words and
  Re-record (R) or Add after (⇧R) — loudness, room tone and joins are matched.
- **Update prompt**: "Update ready — Restart to update" with What's new, download progress, and "Restart when done"
  while projects run; Settings › General shows the version and Check for updates (not in the App Store edition).
- **Attention**: Dock badge with what needs you, notifications that open the exact clip, ⌘K to any video, ↑/↓ and
  ⌘1–9 to switch.
- A live "see the process" log per running project; the step bar follows the engine's real stages, with time left.

### Changed

- One title per clip: the AI's title by default, editable in the editor header and synced to the post titles.
- A clip opens with its transcript (no "listen first"); cover, caption and other edits re-render in the background,
  and publishing uses the edited clip.
- One status vocabulary everywhere; plain words instead of job ids, stage ids and recipe jargon; strict i18n checks.
- Captions follow the requested language (translated when a model is routed), stay inside the safe area, and keep
  the brand spelled right; hashtags are added only when relevant; clips end on whole sentences; repeated takes are
  removed consistently; fixed-intent requests (record / talking head) skip the planning model.
- Home's default platforms follow her choice and accounts, international first.

### Fixed

- "Share a screen too" did nothing (the media permission refused screen capture; the system picker timed out); a
  denied Screen Recording permission now says how to allow it.
- The engine no longer exits on SIGUSR1 (it dumps thread stacks); crash reports name the signal; quitting or
  restarting to update is not reported as a crash.
- The transcript's Restore popover can be clicked with the mouse.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- **Autopilot** (default for new projects): a request sent from Home becomes a project at once and runs to finished
  clips without a plan to confirm; the AI judges unsure filler cuts, every decision is logged with its reason and can
  be changed later. Up to 2 projects run at once, the rest queue (and survive a restart). "Ask me first" restores the
  confirm step (Settings › General, or per project). CLI: `vstudio.project run --autopilot`, `decisions`, `reopen`.
- **Control room**: All projects lists Needs you / Running / Ready / Scheduled & out with a live pipeline per project,
  what the AI decided, clips, and publishing. The old grid stays one click away.
- **Requests without files**: planned from the words (explainer, series, scripts, AI video, slides); links are read
  first (web pages, public Notion pages, exported Notion folders). What only the creator can give comes back as a
  plain "needs" item instead of an error.
- **Drafts instead of files to write**: author steps (promo keep spans and packaging, scripts, cues, configs …) are
  drafted by the AI or the rules and reviewed in plain words (e.g. the transcript with cut sentences crossed out);
  seeded templates are never taken as an answer.
- **Skin smoothing** (磨皮 / 美颜): a face-tracked `portrait-retouch` effect the chat can apply, with strength and a
  beauty mode.
- **Record yourself, redesigned**: script or speak freely, teleprompter under the lens, one record button with a
  countdown, device popovers with a live mic level, takes with thumbnails, and "Finish — make my video".

### Changed

- Transcript cuts and AI chat edits apply at once with Undo (no "Apply cuts" step); a setting brings back
  "Ask before applying AI edits".
- Publish cards, the drawer and the published list open the clip page; posted items link to the post.

### Fixed

- Record yourself: record, retake, camera, mic and Studio sound did nothing with an empty script or were not buttons.
- Home could get stuck on "Couldn't make a plan"; plan errors now say why in plain words.
- The Inbox showed raw YAML for promo steps and a letter instead of a thumbnail.
- Concurrent run-store reads could hang the engine; stalled compose renders and ffmpeg are stopped.
- Cuts render audio and video chains as separate filter graphs; Windows and Linux show Ctrl+ shortcut hints.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- **App Store lint** (`apps/desk/scripts/appstore/appstore_lint.py`, CI `appstore-lint.yml`): fails a build whose
  code references Tcl/Tk or non-public Accelerate BLAS symbols, whose Python carries "itms-services", whose
  entitlements are not sandboxed / include `network.server`, or that has quarantine flags.

### Changed

- The Mac app's engine (and the App Store build's HTML renderer) listen on a Unix domain socket in the app's own
  folder instead of a `127.0.0.1` port; the UI reaches the engine through `app://desk/api`. Windows keeps
  `127.0.0.1`. The App Store build has no `network.server` entitlement and leaves out the YouTube API sign-in (its
  OAuth redirect needs a local port); YouTube posts go through the built-in browser there.
- The engine no longer needs scipy (loudness filters, body-slim smoothing and WAV writing use numpy / numba /
  soundfile); the app's runtime ships without scipy and tkinter (App Review 2.5.1).

### Fixed

- With no usable AI (no key yet, or a local model server without the routed model) a talking-head clip no longer
  fails at its post copy: the title and body are drafted from the spoken lines, as without an AI route.
- The plan card's questions and no-AI plan texts follow the app's language (they could come out in Chinese).
- The in-app sign-in terminal no longer drops a CLI's first output when it prints before the terminal is ready.
- Windows: the engine starts again (the Unix socket server is only defined where Python has one).

### Added

- **Archive projects** (Mac app): 「Remove from list」 is now **Archive** (归档 / Archiver) in a project's menu and in
  bulk select, with an undo toast. An **Archived** tab at the end of All projects shows archived projects dimmed with
  their archive date and a **Restore** button (single or bulk); search and type filters work there, and an archived
  project still opens. Nothing on disk is deleted, and a project with a run going is never archived. Engine:
  `POST /api/history/archive` / `restore` (`{dir}` or `{dirs}`), `GET /api/history?archived=1`.
- **Promo montage from b-roll**: `montage.clips` entries can name a source, `[source, start, end, label]` (a `broll`
  index or file name; the old `[start, end, label]` still reads `highlights`). Each clip is re-encoded onto the
  canvas (vertical clips get a blurred-fill pillarbox, 16:9 is cover-fit) with the privacy crop resolved per source.

### Fixed

- Promo post copy no longer appends the persona's default (career) hashtags: it uses `publish.tag_sets.promo`, or
  only the post's own tags when the persona has none.
- Delivered promos are no longer ~15 Mbps when ffmpeg has no libx264: the render is re-encoded to the platform's
  bitrate target (8 Mbps at 1080p30 for YouTube / 小红书, 6 Mbps for B站) and the delivered size is reported.
- The planner waits long enough for Claude Code on a typical intake (150 s floor, measured) before using Codex.
- The promo footage map no longer flags an `about:` label that is on the card itself (scene title / items, pip tag).
- The promo build no longer crashes when the subset fonts are not installed (system fallback + a warning).
- An engine-port reload during the first page load is no longer reported as "a problem in the app".

## [0.2.2] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- **Promo template**: `pip:` windows (screen full-screen, speaker tile bottom-right), card `scene:` kinds (tiles,
  flow, bars, stat, toast, ranking, columns, checklist, swatch) and card `video:`, a `hooks:` montage at the start,
  `crop: auto` that removes browser bars from screen recordings, and a footage map printed at build.
- Live progress while a plan is made; an agent's live status on the project page.
- **Watermark**: your handle, your own PNG logo, or a logo generated from your handle (drawn locally) on every
  export. Settings › Watermark in the Mac app has live previews on a 9:16 and a 16:9 frame, a corner picker, size,
  opacity, per-platform switches and "Add to every video by default"; the Export card can turn it off for one video.
  The mark sits inside each platform's safe area and above the captions. Off until you set it up.
  Engine: `python -m vstudio.watermark`, `--watermark on|off` on `vstudio.export` and `output render`, and
  `watermark: false` per batch job; settings in `$VSTUDIO_HOME/watermark.json` or persona `watermark:`.

### Fixed

- Attached recordings and folders are kept as promo-recut b-roll instead of being dropped by the planner.
- Author checkpoints show their label, help and file instead of a bare "1 0"; Review lists waiting checkpoints.
- Large plans give Claude Code enough time; a nested `claude -p` no longer attaches to a host Claude Code session.
- Rendering picks a Node.js that runs; delivery creates its output folder; stage errors keep the real stderr;
  external-tool failures say which tool and how to fix it.
- The app reads the creator's persona; covers no longer warp faces; CJK quotes no longer render as tofu.
- `project touch` on a recipe project only writes live status (it no longer drops the project from the list).
- Delivered audio is exactly as long as the picture; montage length is verified; captions never overlap.
- Talking-head speed caps allow a persona's 1.5x body / 2x hooks.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-07

### Changed

- Talking-head jobs default to the notes look, with keywords you review before the render.
- The Mac App Store (Lite) build names no other download and links nowhere; its limits are explained neutrally.

### Added

- A draft post title and body for each clip, written from the final captions.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-07

The first public release: the macOS app for Apple silicon, signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple, plus
an unsigned Windows x64 preview installer. Nothing before it was published as a release; the earlier history lives
in the commit log (formerly `video-studio` and `Daycut`).

### Added

- **Mac app (Reelfold · 千剪)**, MIT, in `apps/desk`:
  - Home composer: describe the job in one sentence and drop the footage; AI proposes a plan card with an estimate,
    then runs a pilot before the full batch.
  - Projects of many clips running in parallel, an inbox that shows only what needs you, and an All work view of
    batches, projects and skill work folders.
  - Chat-first clip editor: big player, a chat column that proposes changes as cards, a timeline with a scrub bar,
    selective undo of one earlier step, before/after compare.
  - Project-level "edit with AI" across every clip at once.
  - Assisted publishing: the upload page is filled in per platform and you press publish (never auto-posts).
  - AI accounts: sign in with your Claude Code or Codex subscription, an API key, or a local model, and switch per task.
  - First-run wizard with queued model downloads; bundled Python runtime and LGPL ffmpeg; auto-update.
  - UI in English, 中文 and Français.
  - Create page (behind a setting): series studio with formats, bible, storyboard and a spend gate.
  - A week of posts in one step: drop this week's footage on Home or Publish; Reelfold plans and makes every clip,
    then lays them out over the week (your words, else each account's usual time, else the platform's rhythm) as a
    preview you confirm with one button.
  - Send feedback (Help menu, Settings, empty states) and Report this problem (failed jobs, crashes): a redacted
    report you read first, opened as a prefilled GitHub Discussion or Issue. Nothing is sent by the app; automatic
    crash reports are off by default.
  - First run in minutes: a built-in sample recording (CC0) and a path that works without any AI account.
  - Transcript editing: cut by words in the transcript, suggestions in the chat, space plays a selection.
  - Publish as a week board with a drawer, plain-language planning, reminders and fill-in of each upload page.
  - Plugins on the Create page: board importers (HyperFrames, CSV / JSON shot lists) and agent runners that make
    shots in parallel lanes, each in its own job folder, with takes and Inbox items for failures.
  - Optional anonymous usage counts, asked once and off until you agree.
- **Windows x64 preview** (unsigned NSIS installer `Reelfold-<v>-win-x64-setup.exe`, attached to the release): the app, its engine sidecar
  and the bundled runtime run on Windows (Media Foundation or OpenH264 for H.264, faster-whisper for speech).
- **Engine**:
  - `vstudio.intake`: one sentence plus the material becomes a validated plan (rule fallback when no model is set).
  - `vstudio.project`: every workflow is a recipe with checkpoints, series, inbox and publishing calendar.
  - Batch orchestration: segment planning, client workspaces, job edits with stale-stage reruns, delivery packages,
    metrics, caption proofreading with a cache.
  - Clip-level editing (`project output list|show|edit|render|undo|redo|ai|effects`) with a cached stage render.
  - `vstudio.llm`: one interface for Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible servers (DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, GLM,
    OpenRouter, Ollama…) and the Claude Code / Codex CLIs, with per-route fallback chains and timeouts.
  - ASR and TTS backend registries, including self-hosted Whisper servers.
  - `vstudio.formats` (defaults per recurring format) and `vstudio.firstpass` (a check before every handover:
    audio, resolution, speed, loudness, first frame, caption terms, cover).
  - Named-entity verification after ASR (place names and cities).
  - One design-theme system for every overlay (editorial default).
  - Recipes for teachers and interview / podcast creators: `lesson-clips` (a lesson cut by teaching point, with
    "Today's phrase" title cards, key-term cards, a recap and study notes in Markdown / PDF; a screen share and a
    camera synced by sound, with screen / picture-in-picture / band layouts) and `interview-qa` (question and answer
    clips that open on the question, tight answers, speakers by role, optional face masks).
  - Bilingual captions (`vstudio.bilingual`): the spoken line plus a translated second line in the theme's
    secondary ink, or the translation only; glossary enforced; per-language SRT / VTT with every export.
  - Launch kits (`vstudio.launch`, `launch-kit` recipe): product launch videos from screen recordings and a
    Playwright capture, with idle stretches speed-ramped, gallery stills, a music bed and per-platform post copy.
  - Studio sound (speech clean-up) and a license-free music library shared by every recipe.
  - Share for review: a page a client can comment on, and the feedback imported back as edits.
  - Plugin registry (`vstudio.plugins`): manifests, permissions, cost kinds; paid plugins only run through the
    spend gate.
- **Platforms**: 20 profiles, each with its own canvas, safe zones, caption box, length, loudness, cover and copy
  limits: YouTube, YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Instagram, X, Facebook, LinkedIn, Threads, Reddit, Pinterest, Snapchat
  Spotlight, Dailymotion, Kwai, 小红书, 抖音, 视频号, B站, 快手, 微博, 知乎.
- **Docs site** at [reelfold.com/docs](https://reelfold.com/docs/) in English, 中文, Français and Español; reference
  pages generated from the engine sources.
- **Website** at [reelfold.com](https://reelfold.com) in four languages.
- Repo: CONTRIBUTING, Code of Conduct, security policy, issue and pull-request templates, roadmap, this changelog.

### Changed

- Renamed to **Reelfold (千剪)**. The repo moved from `zyziyun/video-studio` and `zyziyun/daycut` (old URLs
  redirect). The Claude Code skill keeps the name `video-studio`, and existing installs keep working.
- Monorepo: the engine and skill at the root, the app, website and docs under `apps/`.
- SKILL.md rewritten as a five-step job flow with one routing table.
- Source recordings are never deleted automatically; delivery cleanup is off by default.
- One cache root, `~/.cache/video-studio` (the legacy `~/.cache/vstudio` is still read).
- English is the default language for the app and the website.
- Talking-head projects default to the creator's look: 记笔记 panels, progress-bar chapters and highlighted keywords
  drafted from the clip by the routed text model, strict filler cleanup, 1.25x body / 1.5x hooks from the
  `talking-head` format (one source for the recipe, intake, the desk and the compose scripts; persona
  `formats:` overrides it), a retouched cover, and the hook menu on the default engine too.

### Fixed

- The bundled macOS runtime ships every engine dependency: babel, pypinyin and jsonschema were missing, so in the
  app the named-entity check found nothing and plan / recipe validation fell back to key checks. The runtime build
  and the packaged-app tests now check every package of `requirements.txt`.
- Agent-runner lanes no longer shrink to one on machines with few cores.
- Create: Send to Publish finds an assembled episode also when its folder is reached through a symlink
  (`/var` and `/private/var` on macOS).
- Windows preview: the engine no longer stops answering right after it starts (numpy is loaded before the engine
  starts any thread).
- Projects resume after their last Inbox answer; a run waiting at a checkpoint is listed once; waiting and
  interrupted jobs show on the project board.
- The engine is restarted when it dies after start (never while the app quits), and engine errors are translated
  instead of shown raw.
- Media is served with byte ranges (seeking works), also through symlinked folders.
- English transcripts keep spaces after punctuation and between English words; English sub-word tokens are joined in
  Chinese transcripts; captions split on word boundaries with one shared line breaker.
- Proofreading needs ASR evidence before changing an English word and keeps the glossary off common words.
- Cover runs close their face landmarkers (no deadlock); captions stay clear of talking-head note cards.
- AI fallback works on every path (segment planning, proofreading, chat edit), Codex gets a strict JSON schema,
  and an all-attempts error says what was tried.
- Chat edits always answer; the capability probe no longer misses `--context`.
- Pilot and project failures are visible, with a retry; planning can be stopped.
- Filler cuts keep the word they trim in the captions; AABB reduplication (起起落落) is no longer cut as a stammer.
- A dropped word's tail cut in promo recuts no longer runs into the next word.
- Burned-in finished edits default to the band layout (old captions cropped, new ones below).
- A 9:16 小红书 export gets a 9:16 cover (the 3:4 cover is only for the 3:4 version); the feed's centre 3:4 is
  previewed.
- Post titles fit each platform's title limit when they are written (deterministic shortener, reported in the
  export warnings); exports draft a title when none is given, and the first-pass check no longer reads the hashtag
  line as the title.
- Talking-head posts are no longer empty when you write no copy: a title and a short body are drafted from the final
  captions (your AI account in your voice, else lines you say), fitted to every platform's title limit and shown in
  the review as a draft to edit. Your own title and body are kept.

### Security

- Electron fuses on the packaged app (no run-as-node, no `NODE_OPTIONS` / `--inspect`, asar integrity), hardened
  runtime and notarization.
- API keys in the OS keychain; every IPC call validated; the local engine needs a per-session token.
- No silent mock engine or demo mode in the product: a packaged app always runs the real engine.
